This program is a visualization of different algorithmic design techniques in the world of computer science. Some of these algorithms include:

 - **Array Sorting Algorithms**:
	 - Includes different algorithms such as bubble sort, quick sort, merge sort, etc. Description of each algorithm as well as each algorithm's cons and pros are mentioned. 
	 - Includes a custom array size ranging from 5 elements to 10,000 elements. Any range over 1,000 will symbolize each element with a small bar, rather than showing the entire thing
 - **Traversal Algorithms**:
	 - Includes path finding algorithms, shortest path from A to B with or without obstacles in between. Determining whether an element exists in a set of nodes, etc.

## Usage

 1. Visit [my site](https://alwalidkhan.com/) and scroll down to "**Projects**".
 2. Go to "**Data Visualizer**" and either select the link (which opens a new link) or view the source from github
 3. If **array algorithm** is selected:
	 - Enter the array size
	 - Pick the sorting algorithm and feel free to view the description of it
	 - Start the algorithm process
	 - Will return the sorting algorithm, number of iterations, and time it took in ms to sort the array
 4. If **traversal algorithm** is selected:
	 - Create the start and end points in the maze below
	 - Add obstacles (walls) in between if you wish
	 - Choose the traversal algorithm type (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra)
	 - Click "Start Traversal"
	 - Will either return the path from A to B if it exists, or "No Path Exists from A to B" if no path is found
